## ♟️ About The Project

**Mind in Motion** is not just a portfolio—it's a digital manifestation of strategic thinking. The design philosophy draws heavily from the game of chess: foresight, bold sacrifices, and elegant endgames.

The site features a fully interactive 3D environment where abstract geometric forms represent the complexity of thought. Every animation, transition, and interaction is crafted to feel deliberate and intellectual.

## ✨ Key Features

- **3D Interactive Background**: An abstract, undulating field of cubes powered by **Three.js**, representing a deconstructed chessboard.
- **Procedural 3D Art**: A custom-coded, rotating geometric chess piece (King/Queen abstraction) that requires no external heavy assets.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, frosted-glass cards and navigation using `backdrop-filter` for a premium, futuristic aesthetic.
- **Custom SVG Logo**: A sharp, scalable logo featuring a fragmented head silhouette with a Deep Crimson accent (`#8B0000`).
- **Smooth Animations**: 
  - Scroll-triggered reveal effects.
  - Magnetic custom cursor for desktop users.
  - Parallax floating elements.
- **Fully Responsive**: Adapts seamlessly from desktop monitors to mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure.
- **CSS3** - Glassmorphism, flexbox/grid layouts, and keyframe animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Game logic and interactivity.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** - Real-time 3D rendering.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/pradeep-0918/mind-in-motion.git](https://github.com/pradeep-0918/mind-in-motion.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd mind-in-motion
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`** in your browser.
    - *Note:* For 3D textures to load correctly in some browsers, it's best to run a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code or Python's `http.server`).

    ```sh
    # If using Python
    python -m http.server
    ```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Color Palette**: 
    - **Obsidian (`#111`)**: Depth and mystery.
    - **Off-White (`#F9F9F7`)**: Clarity and canvas.
    - **Deep Crimson (`#8B0000`)**: The decisive move.
- **Typography**: 
    - *Montserrat* for bold, authoritative headings.
    - *Inter* for clean, readable body text.
